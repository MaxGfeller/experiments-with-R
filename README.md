# Experiments with R

These are just some experiments using the [R language](http://www.r-project-org).

## dc-superheroes.R

At the moment this script only draws a plot with the number of new superheroes
over the years.

Execute it via the command line: `R -f dc-superheroes.R`

It will save the output into a file `output/number-of-heroes.jpg`
